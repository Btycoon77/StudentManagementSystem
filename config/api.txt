things to remember;

you have to use these in order to use auth middleware;


=> must be placed inside get
"security":[{"bearerAuth":[]}],

=> must use components outside path,

"components":{
    "securitySchemes": {
      "bearerAuth": {
        "type": "http",
        "scheme": "bearer",
        "bearerFormat": "JWT"
      }
    }
  }
